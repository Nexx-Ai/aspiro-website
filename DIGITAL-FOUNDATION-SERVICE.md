# Digital Foundation — AI-Ready Websites

## Service Page Copy

### Hero Section

**Headline:** Digital Foundation
**Subhead:** AI-ready websites that get you found — by humans and machines.

**Body:**
Before AI can help your business, you need the right foundation. A fast, modern website that builds trust, converts visitors, and speaks the language of AI assistants.

### The Problem

Your website was built for 2015. Google SEO. Desktop-first. Maybe WordPress with 47 plugins.

But customers have changed. They ask ChatGPT for recommendations. They search on their phones. They bounce in 3 seconds if your site feels dated.

If AI assistants can't read your site, they can't recommend you.

### What We Build

**Modern, conversion-focused websites designed for the AI era.**

- **AI-Discoverable** — Structured for ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI to read, understand, and cite
- **Mobile-First** — 70% of your traffic is on phones. We design for that reality.
- **Fast** — Sub-2-second load times. No bloat. No WordPress spaghetti.
- **Conversion-Ready** — Clear CTAs, trust signals, and lead capture that actually works
- **Future-Proof** — Built to plug into AI assistants, chatbots, and automation

### Who This Is For

- Trades & home services (plumbers, electricians, HVAC, landscaping)
- Professional services (accountants, solicitors, consultants)
- Finance & mortgage brokers
- Local businesses tired of their dated website

*If your current site makes you cringe when you share the link — we should talk.*

We review your current site, your competitors, and what's actually working in your industry.

**02 — Build**
We design and build a clean, fast website optimized for humans and AI. Usually 2-3 weeks.

### Then, When You're Ready

Your Digital Foundation is built to grow with you:

→ **Add an AI Assistant** — Handle enquiries 24/7, qualify leads while you sleep
→ **Automate Follow-ups** — Never let a lead go cold again
→ **Connect Your Tools** — CRM, calendar, inbox — all talking to each other

*The website is step one. What comes next is where the magic happens.*

### FAQ

**How is this different from Wix/Squarespace?**
Those are templates. We build custom, with AI-discoverability baked in from the start. No plugin bloat, no slow load times.

**What about my existing website?**
We can migrate your content or start fresh. Either way, you keep your domain.

**How long does it take?**
Most sites are live within 2-3 weeks.

**What if I want AI features later?**
That's the point. Your Digital Foundation is ready to plug into AIPA (our AI assistant platform) whenever you are.
